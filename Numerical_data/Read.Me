This folder is for DL solutions to numerical simulations for advection/CFD

Run the code in FitGenerator2 to train models. Uncommented code is for the custom models. Use the commented code for the all models except those contained in AdvecBlock.py.

To generate the numerical data on your computer use the 2DClawTest.py file. Data is generated in the gen_data() function
